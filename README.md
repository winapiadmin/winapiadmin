- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @winapiadmin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in assembly language and C/C++ (at least)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning multiple things like making a chess engines

Sponsoring the non-archived repositories:

- cppchess_engine: A NNUE chess engine that uses Stockfish nets.

- NNUEParser: (maybe faulty) A wrapper of Stockfish's NNUE support to any other chess libraries. Be careful you need to enforce your project to use Stockfish's project structure.
